 * THE KEYWORDS THIS ACCOUNT SHOULD BUY, FROM ITS OWN RECORDS.

 * group sends its clicks to, and — as loudly as the plan itself — what could
 * NOT be planned and why.
 *
 * NOTHING IS SENT TO GOOGLE HERE. This route reads the company's own database

 * bid with real money, and a plan that uploaded itself on a GET would spend
 * money because somebody opened a screen.
