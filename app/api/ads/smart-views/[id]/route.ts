/**
 * ONE SMART VIEW'S SHEET — served from the last build, rebuilt when it is due.
 *
 * Opening a view must be instant, so the stored sheet is returned as it is and
 * the screen says when it was built. A view whose schedule has come round —
 * or one that has never been built, or one set to rebuild on open — is built
 * here first.
 *
 * `?rebuild=1` forces it, for the person who just changed something and does
 * not want to wait until tomorrow morning to see it.
