/**
 * entrestate.com/business — the platform site.

 * WHERE THIS IS ALLOWED TO RENDER. One rule is absolute: a tenant's own
 * instance ({broker}.entrestate.com) must contain zero vendor wording, so this
 * whole tree 404s there. On any non-tenant host it renders, and it is marked
 * noindex unless the deployment is actually the SaaS one — that way the pages
 * can be reviewed on a preview deployment without the vendor's marketing ever
 * being indexed against a client's own domain.
