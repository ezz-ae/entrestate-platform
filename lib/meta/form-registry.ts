/**
 * Local registry of lead forms created FROM this platform — the mirror of the
 * lib/meta/local-store.ts pattern (query() + CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS).
 *
 * Why it exists: a form created via POST /{page}/leadgen_forms sits in Meta's
 * DRAFT state until an ad uses it, and Meta's /{page}/leadgen_forms edge does
 * not reliably return draft forms. Without a local record, a form the user
 * just created can silently vanish from the forms list. Fetching the form BY
 * ID does return drafts — so we remember every id we created and merge any
 * that Meta's list misses back in (see listLeadFormsMerged).
 *
 * Every call fails soft where possible: a registry problem must never break
 * form creation or listing.
