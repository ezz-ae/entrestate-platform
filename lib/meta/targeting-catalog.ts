// name against Meta's live vocabulary before it is sent (see
// repairTargetingInterests in lib/meta/client.ts) — Meta retires and merges
// targeting nodes on its own schedule, and three consecutive live launches
// failed on stale ids from this era before that repair covered every place
// interests live. A name Meta no longer knows now drops out quietly instead
// of failing a launch. Integrations → Meta Ads → "Check now" reports which
// of these names Meta still recognises.
