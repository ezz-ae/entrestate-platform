/**
 * AUDIENCE PATTERNS — the kitchen.
 *
 * This system sells one thing: Dubai property. It will never advertise a
 * handbag. So the audience builder has no business being a generic interest
 * picker with Meta's vocabulary in it — that is a worse Ads Manager wearing
 * our colours, and the moment someone learns it they have learned Meta, not us.
 *
 * A PATTERN is a description of a PERSON, in the words a property salesperson
 * actually uses: a Levantine expat family renting in Dubai, two children,
 * upgrading from an apartment, mortgage buyer, actively looking. None of those
 * are Meta fields. Every one of them is something the person ordering knows
 * without being taught anything.
 *
 * This module is the translation. It takes that description and produces a
 * real `CampaignTargeting` — locales, behaviours, interests, narrowing groups,
 * exclusions, age band, geo — and the person who ordered never sees any of it.
 * They ordered a burger. The kitchen has soya, heat and technique. There is
 * nothing called a burger back here and it tastes like one.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS DEFENSIBLE AND NOT A GIMMICK. The translation is not a lookup
 * table dressed up. Each trait carries the reason it maps where it does, and
 * the mapping is the accumulated answer to "what did we actually buy that
 * worked" — which the relevance engine measures and which no operator could
 * assemble by hand from a list of forty thousand Meta interests.
 *
 * STRICTNESS is one dial, 0–100, and it is the only knob. It decides how much
 * of the pattern becomes a hard requirement versus a preference:
 *
 *      0  ── everything is a hint. Widest reach, weakest match.
 *     50  ── the defining traits bind, the rest lean.
 *    100  ── every stated trait must be true. Narrowest, most expensive.
 *
 * One dial rather than a form, because the dial is a real trade-off someone
 * can feel — reach against precision — and a form is forty fields nobody can
 * hold in their head.
 *
 * Pure — no I/O. The catalog ids are Meta's; the composition is ours.

  // stands in for investing and for a golden visa (both level 3, so harmless).
  // Meta has no income field in this market, so money is a proxy — and a proxy
  // shared with a product interest is a weak one.
  //
  // The planner's premise is that levels are SEPARABLE: an arm adding level 3
  // must buy different people than the arm that stopped at level 2. A segment
  // in both cannot do that. It is assigned to the LOWER level — the cheaper
  // cut, applied first — and reported, because a plan built on a collision
  // nobody mentioned would read as precision it does not have.
