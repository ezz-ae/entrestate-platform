/**
 * Authority — who may do what, and the events that unlock it.
 *
 * The rules this encodes, as stated:
 *
 *   · "team leader can see all the campaigns and work with them on it but
 *      doesnt own camapigns"
 *   · "always the only one can even delete them and the lead and the system is
 *      the one who paying — anyone else is account with limitations"
 *   · "the system must be fair by defult — any authorised actions by leader
 *      must meet events to get activated — they caant reassign a new lead
 *      within a time frame, they cant reassign a lead has anytype of follow up"
 *
 * The design consequence is that a leader's authority is not a flag. It is a
 * FUNCTION OF THE LEAD'S STATE: the same leader may reassign one lead and not
 * another, and the difference is whether the assigned broker has been given a
 * fair chance yet. So the decision has to be computed per lead, per moment, and
 * it has to be able to explain itself — a denial that cannot say why is
 * indistinguishable from a bug.
 *
 * `decideReassign` is PURE. It takes facts and returns a decision, so the UI
 * can show "unlocks in 6h" using the exact logic the server enforces, with no
 * second implementation to drift. `lib/freehold/authority-db.ts` gathers the
 * facts and writes the log.

// ── The fairness defaults ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// "fair by default". A broker who has just been handed a lead gets a protected
// window to work it before anyone can take it away. Changing the policy is one
// edit here, not a hunt.
//
// There is ONE number, not two. An earlier version carried a second
// `neglectMs: 72h` described as letting a leader move a lead that had gone
// untouched — but it could never change an outcome: any lead old enough to be
// "neglected" was already past the 24h grace, so the ordinary path allowed the
// move anyway. A policy constant that decides nothing is worse than none: it
// reads like a protection that exists. Removed rather than left as decoration.
//
// The deliberate consequence is that the two rules are exactly the two that
// were asked for, and nothing else: a protected window, and untouchable
// follow-up. A lead that HAS been worked is never reassignable by a leader, no
// matter how stale — that needs authority this role does not have.
