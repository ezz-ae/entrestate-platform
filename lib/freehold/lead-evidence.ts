/**
 * EVERYTHING THIS SYSTEM KNOWS ABOUT A LEAD, IN ONE READ.
 *
 * The rating loop shipped reading one column. `SELECT ... WHERE value_rating
 * >= 6` built the seed, `<= 2` built the exclusion, and that was the whole of
 * it — while the same database held, on the same rows, the CRM status, whether
 * the deal closed, what it closed for, whether the person was blocked, whether
 * their phone was dialable, and how thoroughly they read the landing page.
 *
 * The cost of that was not theoretical. A lead who BOUGHT and whom nobody got
 * round to rating was in no audience at all — the single most valuable row in
 * the account, invisible to the thing whose entire job is finding more people
 * like it. And a lead rated 9 in the first phone call who was later blocked
 * stayed in the seed, teaching Meta to find more of him.
 *
 * So this is the one read, and `splitCohorts` in seed-cohort.ts is the one
 * judgment. Every audience this product builds automatically goes through
 * both, which is the only way the rule "outcomes outrank opinions" can be
 * true everywhere instead of true in the module that happens to remember it.
 *
 * TWO THINGS DELIBERATELY NOT READ HERE.
 *
 *   Duplicates. The same person delivered twice is a campaign-quality fact
 *   (spend paid twice) and NOT a reason to exclude anybody — they may be a
 *   perfectly good buyer. "Already in your CRM" exclusion is crm-exclusion.ts
 *   and it is a different audience with a different purpose.
 *
 *   Anything about origin or nationality. Not read, not stored, not a lever.
 *   See lib/freehold/audience-pattern.ts.
 *
 * ONE THING DELIBERATELY REFUSED. A lead the temporal anomaly gate has
 * quarantined (seed_quarantined_at — see lib/freehold/anomaly-gate.ts) is
 * not read at all: its status was set in a burst nobody meant as a judgment,
 * and neither the seed nor the exclusion may be built on it. This is the
 * write-side twin of the training-integrity subtraction below.
