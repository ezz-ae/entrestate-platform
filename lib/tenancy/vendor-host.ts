/**
 * WHAT THE VENDOR'S OWN HOSTS ARE ALLOWED TO SERVE.
 *
 * One deployment serves three different kinds of host:
 *
 *   {broker}.entrestate.com   a tenant's instance — the product, their brand
 *   entrestate.com            the vendor's own front door
 *   machine.entrestate.com    a product door, reserved and never a tenant
 *
 * Only the first was ever thought about. The other two fell through to the
 * property-marketing site that ships in this codebase, so entrestate.com and
 * machine.entrestate.com both answered with a Dubai property portal —
 * "Golden Visa", "off-plan", featured listings. The front door of the company
 * was advertising apartments.
 *
 * This module is the rule for those hosts, kept pure so it can be tested
 * without a server (see scripts/vendor-host-test.ts) and so the proxy stays
 * readable. It does nothing at all unless tenancy is enabled, so the Freehold
 * deployment is untouched.
