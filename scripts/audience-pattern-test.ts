/**
 * The pattern kitchen, locked.
 *
 * A pattern is a description of a PERSON — Levantine family, upgrading, cash,
 * ready — and this module turns it into real Meta targeting that the person
 * ordering never sees. Two things have to hold or the whole idea collapses:
 *
 *  1. THE TRANSLATION MUST BE REAL. If "cash buyer, ready to move" produces
 *     the same ad set as "browsing, unknown money", the vocabulary is theatre
 *     and the operator is picking words that do nothing.
 *  2. IT MUST NEVER LEAK. The describe-to-a-human sentence says WHO, and must
 *     never contain an interest id, a behaviour name or the word "narrowing".
 *
 * The language bundles are the third: nationality is not a Meta field and
 * every product that sells it is selling a proxy stack. Locales are exact.
 *
 * Pure — no model, no database, no network. Runs in `pnpm guards`.
