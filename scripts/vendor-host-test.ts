/**
 * THE FRONT DOOR OF THE COMPANY WAS SELLING APARTMENTS — locked.
 *
 * One deployment answers on three kinds of host: a tenant's instance, the
 * vendor's apex, and the reserved product doors. Only the first was ever
 * routed. The other two fell through to the property-marketing site that
 * ships in this codebase, so a visitor to entrestate.com — and to
 * machine.entrestate.com, the address printed on the business card — was met
 * with a Dubai property portal: Golden Visa, off-plan, featured listings.
 *
 * The rule is small and the cost of it silently reverting is the whole
 * funnel, so it is asserted here rather than trusted.
 *
 * Pure — no server. Runs in `pnpm guards`.
 *
 * The imports are dynamic and the work is inside main(): lib/tenancy/config
 * reads NEXT_PUBLIC_TENANT_BASE_DOMAIN once at module load, so the variable
 * has to be set before the module is first evaluated, and cleared before the
 * second copy is loaded for the switched-off case.
