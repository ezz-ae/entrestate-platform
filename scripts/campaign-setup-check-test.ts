/**
 * The setup check, locked.
 *
 * This reads a LIVE campaign — what Meta holds right now, not what the
 * launcher meant to send — and says whether the money is pointed where someone
 * meant to point it. Two rules govern it, and both are easy to break later:
 *
 *   1. A "wrong" must be really wrong. A false alarm on a correct campaign is
 *      what the overlap panel already did to us in front of the client.
 *   2. Silence must be impossible where it matters. An ad set with no live ad,
 *      no property signal, or Audience Network switched on looks perfectly
 *      healthy from the campaign row above it. Those are exactly the ones the
 *      check exists to surface.
 *
 * Pure — no model, no database, no network. Runs in `pnpm guards`.
